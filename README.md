# Koinobori: The e-commerce fashion web for Japan and vaporwave lovers.

This project allowed me to program with a skilful team from which I learned a lot since the very beginning. <a href="https://github.com/AndyGaSa">Andy García</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lolarufino">Lola Rufino </a> , I wholeheartedly appreciate your commitment and effort. Working with you is always a pleasure. 🌸

The front-end is made with #react #html5 and #sass. For the back-end, we created an #API with Json Server and hosted it on Heroku. 🌟

We have attached great importance to #UXUI. Therefore we have placed our time and efforts on what happens when:

The cart is empty.
The user accesses nonexistent routes.
The user deletes a product.
Logging in and out.
Is there any improvement that you would implement or any article you miss? Don't hesitate to let us know! 🤗
